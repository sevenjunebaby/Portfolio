MACHINE LEARNING
</h3>
<p>
 I’ve built and trained models for various tasks such as classification,
 regression, and image recognition. I worked with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch,
  and applied techniques such as neural networks, CNNs, and decision trees to solve real-world problems.
   My work involved data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization to improve accuracy and performance. 
   This experience deepened my understanding of AI and its potential to drive innovation in different industries.

DATA SCIENCE
</h3>
<p>
Using Scrapy and scikit-learn, I built AI pipelines that start with web scraping and end with meaningful insights.
 Scrapy helps collect data from websites, which I then preprocess using sklearn tools like StandardScaler.
  I apply clustering algorithms such as KMeans or DBSCAN from sklearn to group data—like customer behavior or product trends.
   Post-clustering, I use PCA or TSNE for visualization and silhouette_score for evaluation. This approach turns raw web data into actionable insights for tasks like segmentation,
    recommendation, and anomaly detection.
